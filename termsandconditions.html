            <p>
              SmartMeals is offered through your retailer's website or mobile application. Your retailer's Privacy
              Policy governs how personal information is collected, used, and shared. Breez AI operates SmartMeals as a
              service provider to your retailer and processes certain data on your retailer's behalf.
            </p>
            <p>By using SmartMeals, you acknowledge and agree that:</p>
            <ul class="terms-list">
              <li><strong>Service Provider Role</strong> — Breez AI does not own your personal information. We process
                it only as directed by your retailer, and solely to operate, maintain, and improve SmartMeals.</li>
              <li><strong>Data From You and Your Device</strong> — SmartMeals may collect information you provide (such
                as recipes you save, preferences, and household details) and information about your use of the service
                (such as recipes viewed, selections made, and time spent on pages).</li>
              <li><strong>No Independent Data Sales or Sharing</strong> — Breez AI does not sell or share your personal
                information with third parties for their own marketing or commercial purposes. Any data sharing occurs
                only as necessary to provide SmartMeals to you, fulfill your requests, or as required by law.</li>
              <li><strong>Aggregated & De-Identified Data</strong> — We may use aggregated or de-identified data (data
                that does not identify you personally) for analytics, research, product improvement, and commercial
                purposes. Such data is not subject to consumer privacy rights.</li>
              <li><strong>Data Security</strong> — While we use reasonable measures to protect your data, no system is
                100% secure. We disclaim liability for unauthorized access or breaches beyond our reasonable control.
              </li>
              <li><strong>Jurisdiction</strong> — Your information may be stored or processed in the United States or
                other countries, and privacy laws in those locations may differ from those where you live.</li>
              <li><strong>Personalized Offers and Coupons</strong> — SmartMeals may use information provided by your
                retailer and information about your activity in SmartMeals to personalize your experience, including
                presenting deals, digital coupons, and other offers that may be relevant to you. This may include using
                retailer-provided loyalty and purchase history (such as prior purchases, basket patterns, and offer
                redemptions), along with your preferences and in-app activity, to determine which offers to show.</li>
              <li><strong>Sponsored Content and Measurement</strong> — Some offers, product placements, or
                recommendations may be sponsored or promoted by brands or your retailer. We and your retailer may
                measure how offers perform (for example, whether an offer was viewed, clipped, added to a list or cart,
                or redeemed) to improve relevance and program performance.</li>
              <li><strong>Service Provider Sharing for Offers</strong> — To provide and administer coupons and offers,
                your retailer and Breez may use service providers (such as coupon fulfillment, analytics, and
                measurement vendors). Any sharing is limited to what is necessary to operate these functions on your
                retailer's behalf and is not for the vendor's independent marketing purposes.</li>
