                        <p>We operate in and use service providers located in the United States, however, because
                            BREEZAI works with global companies and technologies, your Personal Information may be
                            transferred outside of the country in which it was originally provided. This may include
                            transfers to third parties, such as service providers or affiliated entities who are located
                            outside the United States or the European Union, where data protection laws may not offer
                            the same level of protection as those in the United States. When we transfer Personal
                            Information outside of these areas, we take steps to make sure that appropriate safeguards
                            are in place to protect your personal information, by using Standard Contractual Clauses (if
                            appropriate) or written agreements.
